# Thoughts on architecture
This would work very nicely with Couch; I'm not storing much in the database,
and the web interface would be convenient; see the hilariously-named
"Wetlands architecture" diagram. These would read and write from the Couch.

* Listings downloader
* Reader workers
* Email correspondance linker
* Website

Some of the above workers would access a file server that stores listings html
pages, public notice pdfs and drawings pdfs. Writes might be over some other
protocol, but reads from the server would be over HTTP so that it could be
reused for the website.


# New version with OCR and whatnot (Email to Scott et al.)

Hi,

I've come up with a new version that OCRs the text and saves things a bit
more nicely. Every time it runs, it updates this site,

http://chainsaw.chickenkiller.com:1419/

adding a spreadsheet for the appropriate date. I'll run it periodically.
I stored all of the files that I downloaded with the earlier version of
this, so I'll run them through eventually as well.

We can keep working out the kinks in the parsing, but I suspect that it's
far enough along that consideration of usability (or whatever you call it)
will be more useful. I propose that you start using these spreadsheets and
that we talk periodically about how you're using it, what doesn't work well
about it, and what features I could add. For example, I foresee these things
coming up.

* Email notifications (They're in the prospectus, but I haven't
written them.)
* If you add another column to the spreadsheet, how do we link it with
the updated spreadsheets from the website?
* [How] do we link email communication to the scraped data?
* Is there a better format than a spreadsheet?

I suspect that we'll come up with a few things that would be nice to have
and that I'll eventually turn that into a website that facilitates those
things. (It might vaguely resemble DocumentCloud; but I don't know yet.)
Does that sound good?

Tom
