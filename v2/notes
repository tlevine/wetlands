# New version with OCR and whatnot
(Email to Scott et al.)

I've come up with a new version that OCRs the text. I've run it on the pages
that I archived with the earlier version. Every time it runs, it updates
[this site](), adding a spreadsheet for the appropriate date. I'll set it to
run periodically and keep working out the kinks in the parsing.

I propose that you start using these spreadsheets and that we talk periodically
about how you're using it, what doesn't work well about it, and what features
I could add. For example, I forsee these things coming up.

* If you add another row to the spreadsheet, how do we link it with the updated
    spreadsheets from the website?
* [How] do we link email communication to the spreadsheet?

I suspect that we'll come up with a few things that would be nice to have and
that I'll eventually turn that into a website that might vaguely resemble a
simplified DocumentCloud but be more customized for your purposes.
