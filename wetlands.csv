LOCATION OF WORK: Sections 75 and 76, Township 8 south, Range 1 east, at the intersection of
Burbank Drive and Pelican Lakes Parkway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in East Baton Rouge Parish, as
shown in the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to clear, grade, and fill an area to construct a
multi-family development, which includes 12 residential apartment buildings, a 257-lot single family
residential subdivision, two commercial out parcels and three storm water detention ponds.
Approximately 17,745 cubic yards of earthen material will be excavated and placed on site. An
additional 266 cubic yards of lime treated base, 990 cubic yards of asphalt, and 2,686 cubic yards of
concrete will be hauled in and used as fill material. Approximately 6.5 acres of jurisdictional wetlands
will be impacted by the proposed activity. The applicant received a permit authorizing fill in 9.2 acres
of wetlands to construct a 236 lot residential subdivision at this site in 2002. The 2002 permit required

- 2 that the applicant purchase mitigation credits from an approved bank and place the remaining
unimpacted 33.3-acre bottomland hardwood tract under conservation servitude. The mitigation
requirements have been satisfied in accordance with permit conditions, but the conservation servitude
has not been obtained.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application

supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment
period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial
comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC
Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address
above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.

- 3 No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.

- 3 No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

LOCATION OF WORK: Sections 75 and 76, Township 8 south, Range 1 east, at the intersection of
Burbank Drive and Pelican Lakes Parkway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in East Baton Rouge Parish, as
shown in the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to clear, grade, and fill an area to construct a
multi-family development, which includes 12 residential apartment buildings, a 257-lot single family
residential subdivision, two commercial out parcels and three storm water detention ponds.
Approximately 17,745 cubic yards of earthen material will be excavated and placed on site. An
additional 266 cubic yards of lime treated base, 990 cubic yards of asphalt, and 2,686 cubic yards of
concrete will be hauled in and used as fill material. Approximately 6.5 acres of jurisdictional wetlands
will be impacted by the proposed activity. The applicant received a permit authorizing fill in 9.2 acres
of wetlands to construct a 236 lot residential subdivision at this site in 2002. The 2002 permit required

- 2 that the applicant purchase mitigation credits from an approved bank and place the remaining
unimpacted 33.3-acre bottomland hardwood tract under conservation servitude. The mitigation
requirements have been satisfied in accordance with permit conditions, but the conservation servitude
has not been obtained.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the

supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment
period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial
comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC
Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address
above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.

- 3 No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Increase the size of an existing barge fleet by one barge width.
The existing barge fleet extends 280 feet channelward and consists of 21 tiers, each containing
one spar barge and eight cargo barges (195’X35’). The applicant proposes to increase the barge
fleet by 35 feet to fleet 21 tiers of nine barges (one spar barge and eight cargo barges) in lieu of
the present 21 tiers of eight barges. No new mooring structures are proposed.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit will close 30 days from the
date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or
objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having
interest in this permit and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the
comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference
the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of
Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or
parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing
to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the
web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension,
and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will

the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and,
inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed
work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our
final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the
proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is
issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall
state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

-3You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as

- 3 critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as

- 3 critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as

- 3 critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as

- 3 critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

- 3 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

- 3 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

- 3 Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory
authority contained in LRS 30:2074 A(3) and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
BULKHEAD AND FILL IN LITTLE BAYOU BLACK IN TERREBONNE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Fritz Dryden, c/o Ryan LeBoef, 801 Kenney Street, Houma, Louisiana
70364.
LOCATION OF WORK: Section 101, Township 17S, Range 17E; in Little Bayou Black at 4852
Imperial Drive, Houma, Louisiana 70360, as shown in the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to install and maintain 22 6-inch piles, 220 feet of
sheet pile, and fill to construct a bulkhead for erosion control. Approximately 250 cubic yards of hauled
in material will be used as backfill. Approximately 0.03 acre of non-vegetated water bottoms will be
impacted by the proposed activity.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the

- 2 Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION:
REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to
comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s
name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively
supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment
period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial
comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC
Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address
above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-

- 3 Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-

- 3 Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity

- 3 will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New
Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [X] Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality,

authority contained in LRS 30:2074 A(3) and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
MODIFICATION OF SHIP MOORING FACILITY IN
MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN ASCENSION PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Barber Bros. Contracting Co., LLC, c/o Richard Wright & Associates, Inc.,
1013 Colony Place, Metairie, Louisiana 70003.
LOCATION OF WORK: In the Mississippi River, left descending bank, at a point about 185.5 miles
above Head of Passes at Geismar, Louisiana, in Ascension Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to install and maintain seven monopiles, two
conveyors, and three concrete slabs with bollards. These additions will allow the existing facility to
stabilize ocean going vessels, ship product, and separate biodegradable products from nonbiodegradable products more efficiently. For construction of the concrete slabs, 44.4 cubic yards of
material will be excavated and hauled off-site and approximately 133 cubic yards of concrete will be
used as fill material. Approximately 0.03 acre of non-vegetated waterbottoms will be impacted by the
proposed activity.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons

- 2 thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION:
REGULATORY BRANCH. Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the
applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the

- 3 evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.

destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the

- 3 evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

above Head of Passes at Geismar, Louisiana, in Ascension Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to install and maintain seven monopiles, two
conveyors, and three concrete slabs with bollards. These additions will allow the existing facility to
stabilize ocean going vessels, ship product, and separate biodegradable products from nonbiodegradable products more efficiently. For construction of the concrete slabs, 44.4 cubic yards of
material will be excavated and hauled off-site and approximately 133 cubic yards of concrete will be
used as fill material. Approximately 0.03 acre of non-vegetated waterbottoms will be impacted by the
proposed activity.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons

- 2 thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the

payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New
Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to: [X] Section 10 of the Rivers
and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for a
Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in LRS30:2047 A(3),
and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
CONSTRUCT THREE DRAINGE PUMP STATIONS WITHIN A FEDERAL LEVEE SYSTEM
IN ST. CHARLES PARISH, LOUISIANA
NAME OF APPLICANT: Pontchartrain Levee District, c/o Trepagnier Law Firm, Attention: Chris
Trepagnier, 331 Girod Street, Mandeville, Louisiana 70448.
LOCATION OF WORK: East Bank Hurricane Protection Levee, south of Lake Pontchartrain, north of
Airline Highway within Section 21, Township 12 South, Range 08 East, and Section 39, Township 12
South, Range 09 East, from St. Rose west to Norco, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana.
EXISTING CONDITIONS: The Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) issued permit #
SE (St. Charles Parish Wetlands) 190, dated 8 August 1995, authorizing the St. Charles Parish Council to
construct four drainage pump stations in association with a hurricane protection levee being constructed
by CEMVN. Subsequent CEMVN authorizations have extended the time frame for construction of the
pump stations and also transferred the permit to the Pontchartrain Levee District (PLD). Only one of the
four pump stations, previously authorized, has been constructed. In 2011 the most recent reauthorization
(for the construction of the pumps) expired. The applicant is requesting reauthorization to construct the
remaining three pump stations.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear, grade, excavate, and fill +12.2 acres of wetlands. The proposed
project would excavate approximately 26,250.00 cubic yards of native materials from +11.4 acres of
wetlands and discharge approximately 4,750.00 cubic yards of materials into +0.8 acres of wetlands. The

2
majority of the fill areas, for construction of the pumps, will occur within the constructed federal levee
footprint. Approximately 3.3 acres of the proposed wetland impacts were mitigated during the East Bank
Hurricane Protection Levee project permitting process. The proposed + 8.9 acres of wetland impacts, not
yet mitigated for, would result from construction of the 3 pump outfalls. The applicant proposes to
compensate for unavoidable wetland impacts at a Corps approved mitigation bank.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Individuals or parties may
request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager
or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request must
be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the
end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be
promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be
continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a
total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference
the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.

3
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of approximately + 8.9 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New
Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to: [X] Section 10 of the Rivers
and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for a
Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in LRS30:2047 A(3),
and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
CONSTRUCT THREE DRAINGE PUMP STATIONS WITHIN A FEDERAL LEVEE SYSTEM
IN ST. CHARLES PARISH, LOUISIANA
NAME OF APPLICANT: Pontchartrain Levee District, c/o Trepagnier Law Firm, Attention: Chris
Trepagnier, 331 Girod Street, Mandeville, Louisiana 70448.
LOCATION OF WORK: East Bank Hurricane Protection Levee, south of Lake Pontchartrain, north of
Airline Highway within Section 21, Township 12 South, Range 08 East, and Section 39, Township 12
South, Range 09 East, from St. Rose west to Norco, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana.
EXISTING CONDITIONS: The Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (CEMVN) issued permit #
SE (St. Charles Parish Wetlands) 190, dated 8 August 1995, authorizing the St. Charles Parish Council to
construct four drainage pump stations in association with a hurricane protection levee being constructed
by CEMVN. Subsequent CEMVN authorizations have extended the time frame for construction of the
pump stations and also transferred the permit to the Pontchartrain Levee District (PLD). Only one of the
four pump stations, previously authorized, has been constructed. In 2011 the most recent reauthorization
(for the construction of the pumps) expired. The applicant is requesting reauthorization to construct the
remaining three pump stations.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear, grade, excavate, and fill +12.2 acres of wetlands. The proposed
project would excavate approximately 26,250.00 cubic yards of native materials from +11.4 acres of
wetlands and discharge approximately 4,750.00 cubic yards of materials into +0.8 acres of wetlands. The

2
majority of the fill areas, for construction of the pumps, will occur within the constructed federal levee
footprint. Approximately 3.3 acres of the proposed wetland impacts were mitigated during the East Bank
Hurricane Protection Levee project permitting process. The proposed + 8.9 acres of wetland impacts, not
yet mitigated for, would result from construction of the 3 pump outfalls. The applicant proposes to
compensate for unavoidable wetland impacts at a Corps approved mitigation bank.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must

LAKE SALVADOR SHORELINE AND WETLAND PROTECTION PROJECT
IN JEFFERSON PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: National Parks Service, attn: Mr. Dusty Haigler, 419 Decatur Street, New
Orleans, Louisiana 70130.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Jefferson Parish, located along the north-eastern edge of Lake Salvador,
near Lafitte, Louisiana, as shown on the attached vicinity map.
CHARACTER OF WORK: This is a request for a Time Extension and Modification of USACE permit
#MVN-2002-3090-EC issued on May 11, 2004. Overall project plans will include excavating and depositing
fill for wetland and shoreline protection along the north-eastern edge of Lake Salvador. The original
permitted project included dredging for access, depositing material for earthen plugs, and constructing stone
dikes for shoreline protection in Lake Salvador. The proposed modifications include an additional 1940 feet
of stone dike foreshore protection along the eastern shore of Lake Salvador, closure of a storm damaged plug
across Tenneco Canal with a stone-dike, and additional rock on the existing dike near the Tenneco Canal.
The potential need for temporary access dredging is intended within open waters areas of the lake and will not
include impacts to vegetated wetlands. As-build drawings will be required from this office, pending the
necessity of access dredging operations. Approximately 14,046 cubic yards of rock will be placed within a
total foot print of approximately 2,150 linear feet.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the

Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of approx. 2,150 linear feet of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

LAKE SALVADOR SHORELINE AND WETLAND PROTECTION PROJECT
IN JEFFERSON PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: National Parks Service, attn: Mr. Dusty Haigler, 419 Decatur Street, New
Orleans, Louisiana 70130.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Jefferson Parish, located along the north-eastern edge of Lake Salvador,
near Lafitte, Louisiana, as shown on the attached vicinity map.
CHARACTER OF WORK: This is a request for a Time Extension and Modification of USACE permit
#MVN-2002-3090-EC issued on May 11, 2004. Overall project plans will include excavating and depositing
fill for wetland and shoreline protection along the north-eastern edge of Lake Salvador. The original
permitted project included dredging for access, depositing material for earthen plugs, and constructing stone
dikes for shoreline protection in Lake Salvador. The proposed modifications include an additional 1940 feet
of stone dike foreshore protection along the eastern shore of Lake Salvador, closure of a storm damaged plug
across Tenneco Canal with a stone-dike, and additional rock on the existing dike near the Tenneco Canal.
The potential need for temporary access dredging is intended within open waters areas of the lake and will not
include impacts to vegetated wetlands. As-build drawings will be required from this office, pending the
necessity of access dredging operations. Approximately 14,046 cubic yards of rock will be placed within a
total foot print of approximately 2,150 linear feet.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the

Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed
work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice
grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested
extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief
will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the
request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of
the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water
Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies
may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of approx. 2,150 linear feet of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 154 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit is
issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to:
[ ] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section
404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority
contained in LRS30:2074 A(3), and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
PERMIT MODIFICATION TO ADDRESS PERMIT NONCOMPLIANCE AND TIME EXTENSION
TO DRILL THE LAWS 94 WELL NO.1 IN WEST BATON ROUGE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Park Exploration Inc., c/o C.H. Fenstermaker & Associates, Inc., attn: Terry Dugas,
135 Regency Square, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Sections 88 and 94, Township 7 South, Range 10 East, near Grosse Tete,
Louisiana, in West Baton Rouge Parish, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Permit modification and extension of time for 5 years to drill the Laws 94 Well
No. 1. Clear, grade, place and maintain fill for an approximate 4,300’ long x 20’ wide access road and 280’ x
300’ ring levee to drill the Laws 94 Well No.1. The access road has two (2) 72-inch wide by 40-foot long
culverts installed for the crossing of Bayou Tommy, three (3) 15-feet wide x 150-feet long truck pullover
locations situated on the eastern side of the constructed access road, and six (6) 15-inch by 20-foot culverts
installed to help maintain sheet flow to adjacent areas. The proposed clearing and placement of fill would
impact approximately 2.8 acres of potentially jurisdictional bottomland hardwoods and 0.03 acre of potential
Other Waters of the U.S. by fill placement. The proposed fill placement would impact approximately 1.2 acres
of potentially jurisdictional wetlands for access road construction and 1.6 acres of potentially jurisdictional
wetlands for drill site construction. A jurisdictional determination is still pending from the US Army Corps of
Engineers. Approximately 2,027 cubic yards of limestone material is to be placed in potentially jurisdictional
areas for access road and drill site construction. Approximately 578 cubic yards of limestone/earthen material
mix is to be placed in potential Other Waters of the U.S. Approximately 4,472 cubic yards of earthen fill
material is to be placed in potentially jurisdictional wetlands for access road and drill site construction as shown
on the attached drawings.
The original permit, authorized on June 22, 2007, stipulated that an existing historic logging road was to be used
as access from the south connecting to Louisiana Hwy 77. An access road was constructed from the north and
east in Section 88 from an existing oil and gas well pad, as described above and shown in the attached drawings.
The well pad was constructed in a northeast orientation as opposed to the permitted north-south orientation.
The well pad was also constructed smaller than authorized (280’x 300’; 300’ x 300’, respectively) in the

original permit. The access road and well pad were both constructed in noncompliance of permit conditions; the
well has not been drilled. The well pad impacts have been mitigated under the original authorization at Cholpe
Acres Wetland Mitigation Area, a Corps approved mitigation bank.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may
request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager or
clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request must be specific
and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial
comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment
period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters
concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application
number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.

environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of NA acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to:
[ ] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section
404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority
contained in LRS30:2074 A(3), and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
PERMIT MODIFICATION TO ADDRESS PERMIT NONCOMPLIANCE AND TIME EXTENSION
TO DRILL THE LAWS 94 WELL NO.1 IN WEST BATON ROUGE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Park Exploration Inc., c/o C.H. Fenstermaker & Associates, Inc., attn: Terry Dugas,
135 Regency Square, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Sections 88 and 94, Township 7 South, Range 10 East, near Grosse Tete,
Louisiana, in West Baton Rouge Parish, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Permit modification and extension of time for 5 years to drill the Laws 94 Well
No. 1. Clear, grade, place and maintain fill for an approximate 4,300’ long x 20’ wide access road and 280’ x
300’ ring levee to drill the Laws 94 Well No.1. The access road has two (2) 72-inch wide by 40-foot long
culverts installed for the crossing of Bayou Tommy, three (3) 15-feet wide x 150-feet long truck pullover
locations situated on the eastern side of the constructed access road, and six (6) 15-inch by 20-foot culverts
installed to help maintain sheet flow to adjacent areas. The proposed clearing and placement of fill would
impact approximately 2.8 acres of potentially jurisdictional bottomland hardwoods and 0.03 acre of potential
Other Waters of the U.S. by fill placement. The proposed fill placement would impact approximately 1.2 acres
of potentially jurisdictional wetlands for access road construction and 1.6 acres of potentially jurisdictional
wetlands for drill site construction. A jurisdictional determination is still pending from the US Army Corps of
Engineers. Approximately 2,027 cubic yards of limestone material is to be placed in potentially jurisdictional
areas for access road and drill site construction. Approximately 578 cubic yards of limestone/earthen material
mix is to be placed in potential Other Waters of the U.S. Approximately 4,472 cubic yards of earthen fill
material is to be placed in potentially jurisdictional wetlands for access road and drill site construction as shown
on the attached drawings.
The original permit, authorized on June 22, 2007, stipulated that an existing historic logging road was to be used
as access from the south connecting to Louisiana Hwy 77. An access road was constructed from the north and
east in Section 88 from an existing oil and gas well pad, as described above and shown in the attached drawings.
The well pad was constructed in a northeast orientation as opposed to the permitted north-south orientation.
The well pad was also constructed smaller than authorized (280’x 300’; 300’ x 300’, respectively) in the

original permit. The access road and well pad were both constructed in noncompliance of permit conditions; the
well has not been drilled. The well pad impacts have been mitigated under the original authorization at Cholpe
Acres Wetland Mitigation Area, a Corps approved mitigation bank.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may
request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager or
clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request must be specific
and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial
comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment
period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters
concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application
number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.

NAME OF APPLICANT: Deep Delta Houseboats, LLC, Attn: Mike Butler, 237 Sports Marina Road, Venice,
Louisiana, 70091.
LOCATION OF WORK: Near the Tidewater Access Canal at 237 Sports Marina Road near Venice, in
Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, 29.23844/-89.36501, in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, as shown on the
enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear, grade, excavate, and deposit fill for construction of 46 elevated campsites,
appurtenant structures, and an access canal for expansion to Venice Marina. The proposed 100-foot wide, 1393foot long, and 8-foot deep access canal would tie into Tidewater Canal and require excavating 22,812 cubic
yards of material within 2 acres of jurisdictional wetlands. A vinyl bulkhead will surround the limits of the
canal. Approximately 6,733 cubic yards of native material will be placed for camp construction, resulting in an
additional .16 acres of jurisdictional wetlands.
Project implementation would result in impacting approximately 2.2 acres of emergent/brackish jurisdictional
wetlands. The applicant proposes to contract with an approved compensatory mitigation bank to offset impacts
associated with the project
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being

or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the
project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by
this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and
the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time
extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period,
will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 2.2 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

PUBLIC NOTICE
Interested parties are hereby notified that an application has been received by the District
engineer for a Department of the Army permit to authorize the following pursuant to ( ) Section
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or (X)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
PROPOSED HARRY L. LAWS AND COMPANY, INC. MITIGATION BANK
IN IBERVILLE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Harry L. Laws and Company, Inc. c/o Coastal Environments, Inc.,
1260 Main Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802.
LOCATION OF WORK: The project area is located between Interstate 10 and Louisiana Hwy 190 in
portions of Sections 9 through 13, Township 7 South, Range 10 East approximately 5 miles northnorthwest of the village of Grosse Tete in Iberville Parish, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The Sponsor proposes to re-establish approximately 197 acres of
agricultural land to a functioning bottomland hardwood forest by topographic modifications and
planting of species commonly associated with this habitat type. The two main tasks of project
construction will be the hydrologic modifications and the planting of the desired hardwood species.
Hydrologic modifications will include leveling of the furrows currently on the property and
modifications to the current drainage ditches within the project area. Currently, the area is mechanically
drained using a pump and canals to facilitate sugarcane growth. The proposed mitigation bank
construction would include the elimination of drainage ditches which funnel surface water to the pump.
The resulting drainage would allow for retention of water from overbank flooding of the bordering
canals and precipitation. The modifications to the drainage system and removal of the pump’s influence
are intended to restore the natural wetland hydrology that has been removed for the farming processes,
without inhibiting the farming activities on neighboring farm properties. Additional details of the
proposed restoration plan are attached for review in the mitigation banking prospectus.

-2The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.
Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,

The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local agencies
and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal.
To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic
properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest factors
listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public
interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would result in
the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp.
Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

PUBLIC NOTICE
Interested parties are hereby notified that an application has been received by the District
engineer for a Department of the Army permit to authorize the following pursuant to ( ) Section
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or (X)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
PROPOSED HARRY L. LAWS AND COMPANY, INC. MITIGATION BANK
IN IBERVILLE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Harry L. Laws and Company, Inc. c/o Coastal Environments, Inc.,
1260 Main Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802.
LOCATION OF WORK: The project area is located between Interstate 10 and Louisiana Hwy 190 in
portions of Sections 9 through 13, Township 7 South, Range 10 East approximately 5 miles northnorthwest of the village of Grosse Tete in Iberville Parish, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The Sponsor proposes to re-establish approximately 197 acres of
agricultural land to a functioning bottomland hardwood forest by topographic modifications and
planting of species commonly associated with this habitat type. The two main tasks of project
construction will be the hydrologic modifications and the planting of the desired hardwood species.
Hydrologic modifications will include leveling of the furrows currently on the property and
modifications to the current drainage ditches within the project area. Currently, the area is mechanically
drained using a pump and canals to facilitate sugarcane growth. The proposed mitigation bank
construction would include the elimination of drainage ditches which funnel surface water to the pump.
The resulting drainage would allow for retention of water from overbank flooding of the bordering
canals and precipitation. The modifications to the drainage system and removal of the pump’s influence
are intended to restore the natural wetland hydrology that has been removed for the farming processes,
without inhibiting the farming activities on neighboring farm properties. Additional details of the
proposed restoration plan are attached for review in the mitigation banking prospectus.

-2The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.
Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local agencies
and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal.
To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic

DESCRIPTION: Proposed establishment of the Kilgore Plantation Mitigation Bank. Proposal includes the re-establishment of +/333.2 acres of bottomland hard wood forest, +/- 184.8 acres of cypress/tupelo, and +/-136.3 acres of fresh marsh
previously utilized for sugarcane production and to include +/- 34.2 acre of buffer habitat . Prior to vegetative
plantings, all surface gravity drainage ditches will be filled, existing sugar cane bedding will be disk leveled and
subsoiling will be utilized. Site preparation and vegetative planting schedules will be conducted in accordance with
that outlined in the prosposed Prospectus. Bottomland hardwoods, cypress, and fresh marsh vegetation will be
planted on 9' centers. Hydrologic connection will be introduced no later than the end of the second growing
season. To achieve hydrologic connection, one 88' x 103' plug and one 67' x 71' plug in the main perimeter levee
will be removed and thirteen 100' gaps will be cut every 500' set approximately 1' below grade in certain perimeter
levees to allow excess storm and floodwaters from the St. Mary Canal, Phillips/ Delahoussaye Canal, and
surrounding wetlands into the restoration tracts. Existing lift pumps will also be removed at this time and relocated
to service adjacent agricultural fields. Culverts/drop pipes that are part of the existing drainage system will be
removed or plugged. Project also includes the restoration of +/- 2,596' of a historical stream bed along the
northwest boundary. A total of +/- 54,808 cubic yards excavated/backfill material will result from the proposed
activities. Adaptive management practices including noxious plant control outlined in the proposed Prospectus may

DESCRIPTION: Proposed establishment of the Kilgore Plantation Mitigation Bank. Proposal includes the re-establishment of +/333.2 acres of bottomland hard wood forest, +/- 184.8 acres of cypress/tupelo, and +/-136.3 acres of fresh marsh
previously utilized for sugarcane production and to include +/- 34.2 acre of buffer habitat . Prior to vegetative
plantings, all surface gravity drainage ditches will be filled, existing sugar cane bedding will be disk leveled and
subsoiling will be utilized. Site preparation and vegetative planting schedules will be conducted in accordance with
that outlined in the prosposed Prospectus. Bottomland hardwoods, cypress, and fresh marsh vegetation will be
planted on 9' centers. Hydrologic connection will be introduced no later than the end of the second growing
season. To achieve hydrologic connection, one 88' x 103' plug and one 67' x 71' plug in the main perimeter levee
will be removed and thirteen 100' gaps will be cut every 500' set approximately 1' below grade in certain perimeter
levees to allow excess storm and floodwaters from the St. Mary Canal, Phillips/ Delahoussaye Canal, and
surrounding wetlands into the restoration tracts. Existing lift pumps will also be removed at this time and relocated
to service adjacent agricultural fields. Culverts/drop pipes that are part of the existing drainage system will be
removed or plugged. Project also includes the restoration of +/- 2,596' of a historical stream bed along the
northwest boundary. A total of +/- 54,808 cubic yards excavated/backfill material will result from the proposed
activities. Adaptive management practices including noxious plant control outlined in the proposed Prospectus may

DESCRIPTION: Proposed establishment of the Kilgore Plantation Mitigation Bank. Proposal includes the re-establishment of +/333.2 acres of bottomland hard wood forest, +/- 184.8 acres of cypress/tupelo, and +/-136.3 acres of fresh marsh
previously utilized for sugarcane production and to include +/- 34.2 acre of buffer habitat . Prior to vegetative
plantings, all surface gravity drainage ditches will be filled, existing sugar cane bedding will be disk leveled and
subsoiling will be utilized. Site preparation and vegetative planting schedules will be conducted in accordance with
that outlined in the prosposed Prospectus. Bottomland hardwoods, cypress, and fresh marsh vegetation will be
planted on 9' centers. Hydrologic connection will be introduced no later than the end of the second growing
season. To achieve hydrologic connection, one 88' x 103' plug and one 67' x 71' plug in the main perimeter levee
will be removed and thirteen 100' gaps will be cut every 500' set approximately 1' below grade in certain perimeter
levees to allow excess storm and floodwaters from the St. Mary Canal, Phillips/ Delahoussaye Canal, and
surrounding wetlands into the restoration tracts. Existing lift pumps will also be removed at this time and relocated
to service adjacent agricultural fields. Culverts/drop pipes that are part of the existing drainage system will be
removed or plugged. Project also includes the restoration of +/- 2,596' of a historical stream bed along the
northwest boundary. A total of +/- 54,808 cubic yards excavated/backfill material will result from the proposed
activities. Adaptive management practices including noxious plant control outlined in the proposed Prospectus may
be utilized to manage any contingencies that may arise. *Approximately 2.8 acres of vegetated wetland, 4.8 acres
of upland spoil/levee, and 11.2 acres of upland agricultural habitat may be impacted as a result of this proposed
activity.*

DESCRIPTION: Proposed establishment of the Kilgore Plantation Mitigation Bank. Proposal includes the re-establishment of +/333.2 acres of bottomland hard wood forest, +/- 184.8 acres of cypress/tupelo, and +/-136.3 acres of fresh marsh
previously utilized for sugarcane production and to include +/- 34.2 acre of buffer habitat . Prior to vegetative
plantings, all surface gravity drainage ditches will be filled, existing sugar cane bedding will be disk leveled and
subsoiling will be utilized. Site preparation and vegetative planting schedules will be conducted in accordance with
that outlined in the prosposed Prospectus. Bottomland hardwoods, cypress, and fresh marsh vegetation will be
planted on 9' centers. Hydrologic connection will be introduced no later than the end of the second growing
season. To achieve hydrologic connection, one 88' x 103' plug and one 67' x 71' plug in the main perimeter levee
will be removed and thirteen 100' gaps will be cut every 500' set approximately 1' below grade in certain perimeter
levees to allow excess storm and floodwaters from the St. Mary Canal, Phillips/ Delahoussaye Canal, and
surrounding wetlands into the restoration tracts. Existing lift pumps will also be removed at this time and relocated
to service adjacent agricultural fields. Culverts/drop pipes that are part of the existing drainage system will be
removed or plugged. Project also includes the restoration of +/- 2,596' of a historical stream bed along the
northwest boundary. A total of +/- 54,808 cubic yards excavated/backfill material will result from the proposed
activities. Adaptive management practices including noxious plant control outlined in the proposed Prospectus may
be utilized to manage any contingencies that may arise. *Approximately 2.8 acres of vegetated wetland, 4.8 acres
of upland spoil/levee, and 11.2 acres of upland agricultural habitat may be impacted as a result of this proposed
activity.*

of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat.
816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Water Resources, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority
contained in Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 30, Chapter 11, Part IV, Section 2074 A(3) and
provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
PROPOSED RV PARK NEAR POINTE AU CHENE MARINA, IN TERREBONNE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Tim Fanguy, 3204 Grand Calliou Road, Houma, LA 70363.
LOCATION OF WORK: Located on the southern end of LA Hwy 665, Section 20, Township 19 South,
Range 20 East, Oak Pointe Subdivision, Pointe Au Chene, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install 700 linear feet of sheetpile bulkhead and place 4,100 cubic yards of
hauled-in earthen material as fill between the bulkhead and an existing access road to facilitate
construction of an R.V. Park. Project implementation would result in permanently impacting
approximately 0.8 acres of intertidal brackish marsh. If the Corps determines that construction of this
project is in the public’s best interest, a mitigation plan would be required that fully compensates for all
unavoidable losses to wetland functions caused by project implementation. The mitigation plan would be
determined in cooperation with state and federal resource agencies.

-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name
and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained
upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [X.] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat.
816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Water Resources, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority
contained in Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 30, Chapter 11, Part IV, Section 2074 A(3) and
provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
PROPOSED RV PARK NEAR POINTE AU CHENE MARINA, IN TERREBONNE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Tim Fanguy, 3204 Grand Calliou Road, Houma, LA 70363.
LOCATION OF WORK: Located on the southern end of LA Hwy 665, Section 20, Township 19 South,
Range 20 East, Oak Pointe Subdivision, Pointe Au Chene, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install 700 linear feet of sheetpile bulkhead and place 4,100 cubic yards of
hauled-in earthen material as fill between the bulkhead and an existing access road to facilitate
construction of an R.V. Park. Project implementation would result in permanently impacting
approximately 0.8 acres of intertidal brackish marsh. If the Corps determines that construction of this
project is in the public’s best interest, a mitigation plan would be required that fully compensates for all
unavoidable losses to wetland functions caused by project implementation. The mitigation plan would be
determined in cooperation with state and federal resource agencies.

-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name
and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained
upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [X.] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat.
816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Water Resources, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority
contained in Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 30, Chapter 11, Part IV, Section 2074 A(3) and
provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
PROPOSED RV PARK NEAR POINTE AU CHENE MARINA, IN TERREBONNE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Tim Fanguy, 3204 Grand Calliou Road, Houma, LA 70363.
LOCATION OF WORK: Located on the southern end of LA Hwy 665, Section 20, Township 19 South,
Range 20 East, Oak Pointe Subdivision, Pointe Au Chene, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install 700 linear feet of sheetpile bulkhead and place 4,100 cubic yards of
hauled-in earthen material as fill between the bulkhead and an existing access road to facilitate
construction of an R.V. Park. Project implementation would result in permanently impacting
approximately 0.8 acres of intertidal brackish marsh. If the Corps determines that construction of this
project is in the public’s best interest, a mitigation plan would be required that fully compensates for all
unavoidable losses to wetland functions caused by project implementation. The mitigation plan would be
determined in cooperation with state and federal resource agencies.

-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name
and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained
upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our
final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by

-3the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is
issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state,
with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the project will be conducted in a manner that is
consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.

proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed
work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our
final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by

-3the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is
issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state,
with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the project will be conducted in a manner that is
consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.

RING LEVEE AND WELL LOCATION IN POINTE COUPEE PARISH

Name of Applicant: Neumin Production Company, c/o Acadian Engineers & Environmental Consultants Inc., Post
Office Box 1126, Eunice, Louisiana 70535
Location of Work: Bayou Close, Morganza Floodway/Atchafalaya Basin Floodway, Sherburne Gas and Oil Field,
Lat 30.53521°, Lon -91.69688°, Section 37, T06S-R08E, approximately 3.0 miles east of Krotz Springs, Pointe
Coupee Parish, Louisiana, as shown on the attached drawings.
Character of Work: Construct and install a 240’ x 350’ ring levee and well pad to facilitate drilling the Louisiana
Central Land, LLC No. 1 well, all for the exploration and production of oil and gas resources. Approximately 14,300
cubic yards of hauled-in earthen material would be deposited as fill to improve and expand the existing old well site.
Project implementation would impact approximately 0.88 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands. As compensation for
any unavoidable wetland impacts, the applicant proposes to purchase mitigation credits from a Corps-approved
mitigation bank.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest
in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Department of the Army permit application must reference the applicant's name and the
Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the address above. Similar letters
concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and
may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of
reproduction.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both
protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being: conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in
general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistoric, or historical sites
or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
The proposed work appears to be located within an area designated by the U.S. Department of Interior as critical
habitat for the threatened Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus). Our initial determination is that the proposed
activity, if conducted in compliance with terms and conditions of a duly authorized permit, is not likely to adversely affect
the Louisiana black bear or its critical habitat. We are requesting U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence with this
determination in accordance with applicable consultation provisions of the ESA.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acres of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will
be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is issued.

- 2 Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.

- 3 You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal may result in the
destruction or alteration of approximately + 1.33 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

The 2012 NWPL will be used in any wetland delineations or determinations
performed after June 1, 2012.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in partnership with other federal agencies
announced today the release of the updated National Wetland Plant List (NWPL). This national
list of wetland plants by species and their wetland ratings provides general botanical
information about wetland plants and is used extensively by federal and state agencies, the
scientific and academic communities, and the private sector in wetland delineations and the
planning and monitoring of wetland mitigation and restoration sites. The list is available at
http://wetland_plants.usace.army.mil.
In the early 1980s, the four primary federal agencies with responsibilities for wetlands USACE,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Natural
Resources Conservation Service realized the importance of utilizing plants and soils as
indicators for wetland delineation purposes. The agencies agreed to assemble panels of wetland
ecologists and botanists to review and revise a national wetland plant list for the U.S. and U.S.
territories. The NWPL released today will replace the FWS 1988 National List of Plant Species
that Occur in Wetlands.
“This is an example of how this Administration is using new science and a transparent process
for regulatory activities. I am pleased that the agencies were able to work closely together to get
this new, more accurate plant list completed,” said the Honorable Jo-Ellen Darcy, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.
Administration of the NWPL was transferred from FWS to USACE in 2006. USACE launched
a Web-based interagency scientific process and created a Web site to update the 1988 plant list.
Scientific names and ratings for 8,200 wetland plants were updated through the Web site, which
also provided for academic and independent peer reviews of the process, resulting in
completion of the list announced today.
The 2012 NWPL will be used in any wetland delineations or determinations performed after
June 1, 2012. The 2012 NWPL may be used in delineation/determination forms prior to that
date, and should be referenced on any data forms used in the wetland delineation/determination
if used.
The NWPL announcement is published in the May 9, 2012, Federal Register and is available at
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-09/pdf/2012-11176.pdf.

scientific and academic communities, and the private sector in wetland delineations and the
planning and monitoring of wetland mitigation and restoration sites. The list is available at
http://wetland_plants.usace.army.mil.
In the early 1980s, the four primary federal agencies with responsibilities for wetlands USACE,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Natural
Resources Conservation Service realized the importance of utilizing plants and soils as
indicators for wetland delineation purposes. The agencies agreed to assemble panels of wetland
ecologists and botanists to review and revise a national wetland plant list for the U.S. and U.S.
territories. The NWPL released today will replace the FWS 1988 National List of Plant Species
that Occur in Wetlands.
“This is an example of how this Administration is using new science and a transparent process
for regulatory activities. I am pleased that the agencies were able to work closely together to get
this new, more accurate plant list completed,” said the Honorable Jo-Ellen Darcy, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.
Administration of the NWPL was transferred from FWS to USACE in 2006. USACE launched
a Web-based interagency scientific process and created a Web site to update the 1988 plant list.
Scientific names and ratings for 8,200 wetland plants were updated through the Web site, which
also provided for academic and independent peer reviews of the process, resulting in
completion of the list announced today.
The 2012 NWPL will be used in any wetland delineations or determinations performed after
June 1, 2012. The 2012 NWPL may be used in delineation/determination forms prior to that
date, and should be referenced on any data forms used in the wetland delineation/determination
if used.
The NWPL announcement is published in the May 9, 2012, Federal Register and is available at
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-09/pdf/2012-11176.pdf.

Resources Conservation Service realized the importance of utilizing plants and soils as
indicators for wetland delineation purposes. The agencies agreed to assemble panels of wetland
ecologists and botanists to review and revise a national wetland plant list for the U.S. and U.S.
territories. The NWPL released today will replace the FWS 1988 National List of Plant Species
that Occur in Wetlands.
“This is an example of how this Administration is using new science and a transparent process
for regulatory activities. I am pleased that the agencies were able to work closely together to get
this new, more accurate plant list completed,” said the Honorable Jo-Ellen Darcy, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.
Administration of the NWPL was transferred from FWS to USACE in 2006. USACE launched
a Web-based interagency scientific process and created a Web site to update the 1988 plant list.
Scientific names and ratings for 8,200 wetland plants were updated through the Web site, which
also provided for academic and independent peer reviews of the process, resulting in
completion of the list announced today.
The 2012 NWPL will be used in any wetland delineations or determinations performed after
June 1, 2012. The 2012 NWPL may be used in delineation/determination forms prior to that
date, and should be referenced on any data forms used in the wetland delineation/determination
if used.
The NWPL announcement is published in the May 9, 2012, Federal Register and is available at
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-09/pdf/2012-11176.pdf.

DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS IN SAINT LANDRY PARISH

Name of Applicant: Town of Leonville, c/o Sellers and Associates, Inc., 148-B Easy Street, Lafayette, Louisiana
70508
Location of Work: Unnamed tributary of Bayou Teche (Lateral N-9), between Lat 30.47312°, Lon -91.98047°
and Lat 30.47084°, Lon -91.99080°, Sections 16 and 17, T07S-R05E, Leonville, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana as
shown on the attached drawings.
Character of Work: Excavate approximately 10,650 cubic yards of native earthen material along 4,486 linear
feet of an existing drainage lateral, and replace four (4) existing road crossings with adequately-sized structures,
all to increase the hydraulic capacity of the channel and structures to alleviate flooding. Approximately 7,850
cubic yards of the excavated material would be spread on site and 2,800 cubic yards hauled off-site to a non-wet
location. Approximately 642 cubic yards of earthen fill, 243 cubic yards of rock revetment, and 165 cubic yards
of flexible revetment would be deposited as fill during replacement of the crossings. Project implementation
would impact approximately 3.6 acres of other waters of the U.S.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed, so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Department of the Army permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers at the address above. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must
reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment
of costs of reproduction.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern
for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to
accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may
be relevant to the proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being:
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs,
considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an
Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistoric, or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration
of 0.0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is
that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the
Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water
quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is
issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both
protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being: conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in
general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistoric, or historical sites
or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acres of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will
be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be
held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a
public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem
likely to have interest in the matter.

PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY WELL SITE IN VERNON PARISH
Name of Applicant: Town of New Llano, c/o Pan American Engineers-Alexandria, Inc., 1717 Jackson Street,
Alexandria, Louisiana 71301
Location of Work: Bayou Castor, Lat 31.09778°, Lon -93.27°, Section 3, T01N-R09W, west side of US Highway 171,
approximately 1 mile south of New Llano, Vernon Parish, Louisiana, as shown on the attached drawings.
The work described below was partially completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit and was in
violation of Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work have been deferred.
Character of Work: Perform construction activities as required to install a water well assembly, 200,000-gallon storage
tank, and appurtenant structures, all to develop a potable public water supply source. Approximately 290 yd3 of excavated
native earthen material, along with approximately 1,940 yd3 of hauled-in earthen material and 40 yd3 of crushed stone,
would be deposited as fill. Concrete pads will be placed to support equipment. Also, vegetative debris resulting from
clearing operations would be disposed of through burial on site. Project implementation would impact approximately 0.5
acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands. As compensation for any unavoidable wetland impacts, the applicant proposes
to purchase mitigation credits from a Corps-approved mitigation bank.
The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, if issuance of a permit
is determined to be contrary to the overall public interest.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit is
issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit is
issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit is
issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Name of applicant: Sidney Moffett, c/o Kodi Babin, T. Baker Smith, P.O. Box 2266, Houma, Louisiana 70361
Location of work: 29.6633oN, -91.11307oW, on LA Highway 182, in Amelia, Louisiana, in ST. MARY Parish, as
shown on the enclosed drawings.
The work described below was completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit and was in violation of
Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work have been deferred.
Character of work: Clear approximately 8.3 acres, excavate approximately 11 acres, and place approximately 112,093
cubic yards of earthen fill over 5.3 acres, all to develop commercial lots. The applicant intends to purchase credits from an
approved mitigation bank in the same hydrologic basin to compensate for 24.6 acres of project related impacts on the
aquatic environment.
The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, if issuance of a permit is
determined to be contrary to the overall public interest.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in
this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit
Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by
writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office
prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be
promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to
the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.

be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative
impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered
including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental
concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,

shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also
used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acre(s) of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public
hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely
to have interest in the matter.

Name of applicant: Sidney Moffett, c/o Kodi Babin, T. Baker Smith, P.O. Box 2266, Houma, Louisiana 70361
Location of work: 29.6633oN, -91.11307oW, on LA Highway 182, in Amelia, Louisiana, in ST. MARY Parish, as
shown on the enclosed drawings.
The work described below was completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit and was in violation of
Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work have been deferred.
Character of work: Clear approximately 8.3 acres, excavate approximately 11 acres, and place approximately 112,093
cubic yards of earthen fill over 5.3 acres, all to develop commercial lots. The applicant intends to purchase credits from an
approved mitigation bank in the same hydrologic basin to compensate for 24.6 acres of project related impacts on the
aquatic environment.
The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, if issuance of a permit is
determined to be contrary to the overall public interest.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in
this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit

BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by
writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office
prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be
promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to
the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.

be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative
impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered
including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental
concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,

shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also
used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acre(s) of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public
hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely
to have interest in the matter.

The work described below was completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit and was in violation of
Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work have been deferred.
Character of work: Clear approximately 8.3 acres, excavate approximately 11 acres, and place approximately 112,093
cubic yards of earthen fill over 5.3 acres, all to develop commercial lots. The applicant intends to purchase credits from an
approved mitigation bank in the same hydrologic basin to compensate for 24.6 acres of project related impacts on the
aquatic environment.
The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, if issuance of a permit is
determined to be contrary to the overall public interest.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in
this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit
Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by
writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office
prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be
promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to
the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.

be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative
impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered
including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental
concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,

shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also
used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acre(s) of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public
hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely
to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Louisiana, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: To install and maintain a pier, bulkhead, and pilings for an American with
Disabilities Act approved fishing pier, boat dock improvements, and barge mooring facility. The fishing pier
will include 3-piling clusters, a walkway section, graded ramp, bulkhead, rip-rap, and concrete parking area. In
Barataria Bay, 20-7 pile clusters will be constructed for a 1,893-foot offshore barge mooring facility. Vessels
moored at this facility will not exceed 100-feet on either both side of the structure. Approximately 28 cubic
yards of concrete will be hauled in for parking areas and 94.8 cubic yards of rock rip-rap will be placed to
backfill bulkheads. Project implementation would result in approximately 0.02 acres of non-vegetated
waterbottoms to be impacted. No jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated to be directly affected by this action.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
BANK STABILIZATION AND BOAT DOCK ON COMPANY CANAL, IN TERREBONNE
PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Karey Scott, 125 Texas Gulf Road, Bourg, Louisiana 70343.
LOCATION OF WORK: Located in Section 10, Township 17 South, Range 18 East, alongside
Company Canal, Bourg, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install approximately 85 linear feet of rock bulkhead with a 1” thick cap of
concrete. Construct a 4 foot by 30 foot pile supported boat dock. The bulkhead and dock would be
situated parallel to the existing shoreline with the outer most edge extending approximately 15 feet
channel-ward therefrom. Approximately 0.01 acres of unvegetated waterbottom would be impacted by
this project.

-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name
and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained
upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the

-3destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilizatio,Il oqmR9rtant resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal musfbe balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts
of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the prop~s~d work woul~fneither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson­
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 0.04 acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilizatio,Il oqmR9rtant resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal musfbe balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts
of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the prop~s~d work woul~fneither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson­
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 0.04 acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, v;vithin the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity. the
reasons for holding a public hearing.

PUBLIC NOTICE
Interested parties are hereby notified that an application has been received by the District
engineer for a Department of the Army permit to authorize the following pursuant to (X) Section
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or (X)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
PROPOSED WADESBORO ROAD MITIGATION BANK
IN TANGIPAHOA PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Jimmy Scherer/Wadesboro Road Mitigation Bank, LLC c/o Thom
Barlow, Maurepas Environmentalists, 39016 S. Thibodeaux Road, Ponchatoula, Louisiana
70454.
LOCATION OF WORK: The project area includes approximately 310.7 acres located in
Section 38 Township 7 South, Range 7 East at the end of Shingle Mill Rd., Ponchatoula,
Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The Sponsor proposes to establish a wetland mitigation bank by
enhancing 93.1 acres of bottomland hardwood habitat, re-establishing approximately 3.0 acres of
bottomland hardwood habitat, and preserving approximately 200.4 acres of cypress/tupelo
swamp habitat. The existing condition of the proposed mitigation bank includes cutover with
large, scattered trees remaining. The Sponsor proposed to improve hydrology by deep
tilling/disking 1,345 of existing road, filling in roadside ditches, and installing culverts.
Additional details of the proposed restoration plan are attached for review in the mitigation
banking prospectus.
The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.

-2Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3-

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

PROPOSED WADESBORO ROAD MITIGATION BANK
IN TANGIPAHOA PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Jimmy Scherer/Wadesboro Road Mitigation Bank, LLC c/o Thom
Barlow, Maurepas Environmentalists, 39016 S. Thibodeaux Road, Ponchatoula, Louisiana
70454.
LOCATION OF WORK: The project area includes approximately 310.7 acres located in
Section 38 Township 7 South, Range 7 East at the end of Shingle Mill Rd., Ponchatoula,
Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The Sponsor proposes to establish a wetland mitigation bank by
enhancing 93.1 acres of bottomland hardwood habitat, re-establishing approximately 3.0 acres of
bottomland hardwood habitat, and preserving approximately 200.4 acres of cypress/tupelo
swamp habitat. The existing condition of the proposed mitigation bank includes cutover with
large, scattered trees remaining. The Sponsor proposed to improve hydrology by deep
tilling/disking 1,345 of existing road, filling in roadside ditches, and installing culverts.
Additional details of the proposed restoration plan are attached for review in the mitigation
banking prospectus.
The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.

-2Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3-

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilizatiorl of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be b.alanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts
of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment andlor an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would:peither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson­
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 0.04 acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public

hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would:peither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson­
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 0.04 acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public

hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.

LOCATION OF WORK: Bayou St. Dennis north to Long Bay, Latitude 29.53792, Longitude 90.07919, Barataria Bay, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant is requesting Corps authorization to prop-wash an access
channel and slip to install 8 temporary 3 pile clusters for a drilling barge. If the well is productive a well
protector platform will be installed. The proposal would prop-wash approximately 64,261 cubic yards of
materials from + 12.27 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms. Prop-wash areas are not to exceed a -7.5 foot
depth. No vegetated resources would be impacted. Applicant proposes to make a contribution to the
Coastal Restoration Trust Fund.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's

2
name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality at the address above. The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as threatened or
endangered by Endangered Species Act (ESA) nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any ESA listed species. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need
for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the U.S. Departments of Interior
and/or Commerce.

3
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
temporary destruction or alteration of approximately 12.27 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

LOCATION OF WORK: Bayou St. Dennis north to Long Bay, Latitude 29.53792, Longitude 90.07919, Barataria Bay, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant is requesting Corps authorization to prop-wash an access
channel and slip to install 8 temporary 3 pile clusters for a drilling barge. If the well is productive a well
protector platform will be installed. The proposal would prop-wash approximately 64,261 cubic yards of
materials from + 12.27 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms. Prop-wash areas are not to exceed a -7.5 foot
depth. No vegetated resources would be impacted. Applicant proposes to make a contribution to the
Coastal Restoration Trust Fund.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's

2
name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality at the address above. The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as threatened or
endangered by Endangered Species Act (ESA) nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any ESA listed species. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need
for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the U.S. Departments of Interior
and/or Commerce.

3
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
temporary destruction or alteration of approximately 12.27 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as threatened or
endangered by Endangered Species Act (ESA) nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any ESA listed species. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need
for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the U.S. Departments of Interior
and/or Commerce.

3
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
temporary destruction or alteration of approximately 12.27 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

PUBLIC NOTICE
Interested parties are hereby notified that an application has been received by the District
engineer for a Department of the Army permit to authorize the following pursuant to (X) Section
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or (X)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
PROPOSED BAYOU GRAND COTEAU MITIGATION BANK, PHASE I ADDENDUM
IN LAFOURCHE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: The Cypress Knee Ranch, LLC c/o Lee Walters, C-K Associates,
LLC, 17170 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70810.
LOCATION OF WORK: The project area is located in Section 26, Township 5 South and Range 11
East adjacent to the Bayou Grand Coteau Mitigation Bank and is approximately 1.3 miles northeast of
the intersection of LA Highway 3087 and LA Highway 182 northeast of Bayou Blue, Louisiana along
LA Highway 182.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The Sponsor proposes to establish a wetland mitigation bank comprised
of 118.1 acres of bottomland hardwoods wetland ecosystem. Specifically, this will consist of 64.4 acres
of bottomland hardwood re-establishment, 18.9 acres of bottomland hardwood rehabilitation, and 34.8
acres of bottomland hardwood enhancement. Approximately 4,000 linear feet of existing agricultural
canals will be filled, plugged and swaled with earthen material from the existing spoil bank. Any
shallow cross drains designed to carry surface water from agricultural fields will be eliminated through
site preparation activities (i.e. disking and ripping). Additional details of the proposed restoration plan
are attached for review in the mitigation banking prospectus.
The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.

-2Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3-

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3-

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The
benefit that reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife
values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, pre-historical or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnus-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant’s proposal would
result in the alteration of 0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3-

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties

OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES IN IBERIA PARISH

Name of Applicant: Hilcorp Energy Company, c/o Tim Morton & Associates, Inc., 730 East Kaliste Saloom Road,
Lafayette, Louisiana 70508
Location of Work: West Cote Blanche Bay and Hawkins Bayou, Marsh Island Wildlife Refuge, Lake Sand Gas
Field, Lat 29.55506°, Lon -91.735°, Section 15, T17S-R07E, approximately 14 miles southeast of Cypremort Point,
Iberia Parish, Louisiana, as shown on the attached drawings.
Character of Work: Conduct propwash (51,060 cubic yards) and hydraulic dredging (28,342 cubic yards) to construct
approximately 9,500 linear feet of 70-feet wide access channel, a 345-feet by 160-feet slip with 90-feet by 90-feet wing,
and install via jetting (1,702 cubic yards) approximately 12,353 linear feet of (1) 3-inch and (1) 4-inch diameter
flowlines, all to access, drill, and produce the S.L. 3209 Well No. 4 in the Lake Sand Field. Hydraulically dredged
material would be pumped into a shallow open water area within the Marsh Island Wildlife Refuge in a manner
conducive to marsh creation. Project implementation would impact approximately 0.14 acres of saline marsh and 24.6
acres of non-vegetated water bottoms.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest
in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Department of the Army permit application must reference the applicant's name and the
Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the address above. Similar letters
concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and
may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of
reproduction.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both
protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being: conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in
general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistoric, or historical sites
or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 24.7 acres of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will
be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be
held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a
public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem
likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of 0 acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies
with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources
Program. The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received
approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans District
of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [ ] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3,
1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality

LRS30:2047 A(3), and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN COVINGTON, LA
NAME OF APPLICANT: Ruddigore, LLC, ℅ Hydrik Wetlands Consultants, Attn: Mike Henry,
604 West Charles Street, Hammond, Louisiana 70401.
LOCATION OF WORK: An undeveloped 40.65 acre area west of N. HWY 190 and north of Village Lane
adjacent to the existing Northpark Development in Covington, Louisiana, St. Tammany Parish,
Latitude: 30.44654, Longitude: -90.08574, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear, grade, excavate, and deposit fill to construct roads, parking, building
slabs, bridge crossings, detention ponds, drainage, and appurtenant infrastructure for the expansion of the
Northpark Phase I development. Project implementation would directly impact approximately 10.5 acres of
mixed pine savannah and 0.4 acres of ‘other’ waters of the U.S. The applicant proposes to contract with an
approved compensatory mitigation bank to offset impacts associated with the project.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning
the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. Individuals
or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the
project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by
this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and
the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time

-2extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period,
will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, ATTN: Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
beheld to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, ATTN: Water Quality

29.94041/longitude: -89.99631, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install and maintain a guide rail system and turning dolphin adjacent to a
previous one damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Pieces of sheetpile will be driven to form a closed circular cell.
The inside would be filled with 700 cubic yards of stone and capped with concrete. Project implementation
would result in impacting 0.01 acres of non-vegetated waterbottoms. No jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated
to be directly affected by this action.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps

payment of costs of reproduction.

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
This project borders the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. All known properties listed on
the National Register of Historic Places have been identified and avoided in the project drawings. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, ATTN: Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
beheld to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.

endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, ATTN: Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
beheld to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.

29.94041/longitude: -89.99631, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Install and maintain a guide rail system and turning dolphin adjacent to a
previous one damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Pieces of sheetpile will be driven to form a closed circular cell.
The inside would be filled with 700 cubic yards of stone and capped with concrete. Project implementation
would result in impacting 0.01 acres of non-vegetated waterbottoms. No jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated
to be directly affected by this action.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning
the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
This project borders the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. All known properties listed on
the National Register of Historic Places have been identified and avoided in the project drawings. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, ATTN: Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
beheld to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies
with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources
Program. The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received
approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.

The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with

-2Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of
red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not
have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is
subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies
with and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources
Program. The Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received
approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.

CHARACTER OF WORK: Install and maintain a wharf, elevated boardwalk, concrete chain wall, and
appurtenant structures for construction of a fisheries market on and adjacent to the G.I.W.W. The wharf and
boardwalk will be a pile-supported wooden structure extending into the channel approximately 77-feet. No
jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated to be directly affected by this action.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit

the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. Individuals
or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the
project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by
this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and
the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time

-2extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period,
will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you

FILL IN TANGIPAHOA PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: WAL-MART REAL ESTATE BUSINESS TRUST, c/o Duplantis Design Group, P.C.,
ATTN: Heather R. Klingman, 314 East Bayou Road, Thibodaux, Louisiana 70301.
LOCATION OF WORK: On U.S. Highway 51, approximately 0.37 mile north of its intersection with Louisiana
Highway 22, Section 59, Township 7 South – Range 7 East, near Ponchatoula, Louisiana, in TANGIPAHOA PARISH, as
shown on the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Place fill in an area to construct a retail store with associated drainage, parking and utility
improvements. Approximately 7,890 cubic yards of material will be deposited on the project site. Preliminary review of
the information furnished by the applicant indicates that no wetlands would be affected, but approximately 1.21 acres of
jurisdictional “other waters of the U.S.” will be directly impacted by re-routing of drainage associated with project
implementation.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in
this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit
Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing
to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request
must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the
initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the
decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment
period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Similar letters concerning
the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.

The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and may be
examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of
reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative
impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection
and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety,
food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of
the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and
to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists that
the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of
0
acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the
proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required
from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public
hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to
have interest in the matter.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and
to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists that
the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of
0
acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the
proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required
from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public
hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to
have interest in the matter.
